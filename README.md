# 2022 Best Universities in the United States

## Inspiration and Intro to APP
### Welcome to the Top US Universities Attributes and Visualization Application!! <br> In todayâ€™s world of hyper competitive, hyper selective university admissions expectations, it has become increasingly important to have the data necessary to help guide university selection and evaluation efforts. <br> Various analyses have been completed to provide select insights, and data are available for search to enable self-service investigation. Some of the questions we can help you answer include:
- What is the ranking of universities across the US?
- Which universities are ranked within the top x # of universities?
- What universities can I consider given my SAT score?
- What are expected SAT ranges for university niche grade?
- Where are the best universities located? Which are in my residential State?
- Which schools are hardest to get into?
- What is the estimated Net Cost of Attendance for a given School?

*According to Niche, the best colleges ranking is based on rigorous analysis of academic, admissions, financial, and student life data from the U.S. Department of Education along with millions of reviews from students and alumni. The ranking compares more than 1,000 top colleges and universities in the U.S. This year's rankings have reduced the weight of ACT/SAT scores to reflect a general de-emphasis on test scores in the college admissions process.*

## Extraction, Transformation and Load:
- [Web Scraping](Niche_Scraping): We did a web scraping from Niche.com to obtain data from top 800 universities in the United States.<br>
- [Geocoding API for locations](Location_Info): We obtained the locations of the universities using Google Geocoding API.<br>
- [Final data file](Data): After data transformation, we saved our data here. <br>
- [Load data](insert_data.py): We stored our data using MongoDB Atlas Database.

## Flask app and deploy:
[Flask app](app.py): We used Flask to develop our app and the final deployment used Heroku.

## More about our App:

## Challenges and Learning
<strong>Challenge 1 - Understanding the Setup</strong><br>
While having a deep capability in each individual technology, we lacked experience in using all of the technologies together as a cohesive application.<br>
<strong>Challenge 2 - Assigning geo coordinates to universities</strong><br>
In order to assign geo coordinates to universities we had to utilize Google API to search for the schools exact location. <br>
<strong>Challenge 3 - Pivot on data source utilized</strong><br>
The original data source that we attempted to utilize did not allow for web scraping so we had to shift our source utilizing the Niche website. <br>
<strong>What's Next for the App?</strong><br>
- Applying the application to alternate levels of education.
- Expanding the geographic location of the app, global universities.
- Adding additional parameters on which to filter schools.
